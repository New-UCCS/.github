# Welcome

This is the unoffical GitHub organization for the [University of Colorado Colorado Springs](https://www.uccs.edu). This is all for fun, and has zero affilifation to the college. The old organization is no longer running, so we decided to make this new one.

## Who is able to join?

* We welcome anyone in the Engineering Field to join our organization and contribute.

## How do I join?
Please email [uccs@nolantaft.com] your UCCS email and your GitHub name! One of our admins will send you an invite, and you will be notified.

## Contributing
* Once added to the organization you can request to join a team based on your major/minor or interested major/minor.

* Once you are added to a team feel free to share your best work! 

* Please note: documentation is an absolute must. Lack of documentation can lead to issues in understanding what your code is for. 

* All languages are accepted.

* **Pull requests are appreciated on peers.** 

* Please make sure to update code to make it as appropriate as needed.


## Are you looking to hire from UCCS?
**Get into contact with me and I will help you find someone perfect for you!**

This is a diverse community, so finding someone that fits your needs may be difficult. 

I will also be able to help you get into direct contact with that person. Everyone in here has been linked with a contact email, so I will reach out to them and get the details you request.

*I want to keep everyone safe, happy, and confidential at discretion*
