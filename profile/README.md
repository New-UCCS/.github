# Welcome

This is the unoffical GitHub organization for the [University of Colorado Colorado Springs](https://www.uccs.edu). This is all for fun, and has zero affilifation to the college. The old organization is no longer running, so we decided to make this new one.

## What is this for?
* This is a GitHub for all Engineering students to showcase their profilios to Employeers and outside contractors that are linked to UCCS.

## Who is able to join organization?

* Anyone in the Engineering Field at UCCS is able to join our organization and contribute.

## How do I join the organization?
* Please email [uccs@nolantaft.com](mailto:uccs@nolantaft.com) your UCCS email and your GitHub name! One of our admins will send you an invite, and you will be notified.
* Or just click this: [Mail Me](mailto:uccs@nolantaft.com?subject=Register&body=%5BGithub%20Name%5D%0D%0A%5BUCCS%20Email%5D)
## Who is able to look at the projects from the organization?
* Anyone who is willing to look at the amazing projects of UCCS!

* We will have people from businesses and companies looking at the projects from UCCS, so once you join make sure to share your best work.

# Contributing
* Once added to the organization you can request to join a team based on your major/minor or interested major/minor.

* Once you are added to a team feel free to share your best work! 

### How to contribute and share your work?

* First click on the teams tab and go through the tutorials then click on your Major's team, and click on your personal repo. To start sharing your work start by uploading your files and editing your read me file to show documentation of your work. Feel free to edit or look at the templates we made as an example read me file.

* Please note: documentation is an absolute must. Lack of documentation can lead to issues in understanding what your code is for. 

* All languages are accepted.

* **Pull requests are appreciated on peers.** 

* Please make sure to update code to make it as appropriate as needed.
