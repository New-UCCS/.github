## Contributing

* Please note: documentation is an absolute must. Lack of documentation can lead to issues in understanding what your code is for. 

* All languages are accepted.

* **Pull requests are appreciated on peers.** 

* Please make sure to update code to make it as appropriate as needed.


## Are you looking to hire from UCCS?

This is a diverse community, so finding someone that fits your needs may be difficult. 

I will also be able to help you get into direct contact with that person. Everyone in here has been linked with a contact email, so I will reach out to them and get the details you request.
